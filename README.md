GitHub repository for the UNT Eagle Eye team

The UNT Eagle Eye web application is an independent, student-driven platform designed to allow University of North Texas (UNT) 
students to rate and review professor performance beyond the standardized SPOT (Student Perception of Teaching)evaluation. 
This system provides students with an unrestricted and anonymous space to share their experiences, helping others make informed
decisions about their courses and instructors.
